DBIx-FedDB version 0.0.1

Enables the use of a federated database - currently specific to BLAST result sorting. Uses 
LWP::Simple to get the results through pre-installed Catalyst web service. A Catalyst 
Controller module is included with the distribution.

The current project includes 100 billion HSPs from 11 million protein sequences and will be 
run across 8-10 machines from a network adjacent server.

I intend to generalize the functionality to suit the module name, although a plug-in system 
seems likely, so a plugin would need to be (and could be) developed per app.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


DEPENDENCIES

None.
